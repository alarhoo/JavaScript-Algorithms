JavaScript Algorithms by Codevolution

## Algorithm
A set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

### Characteristics of Algorithms
- Well defined inputs and outputs
- Each should be clear and unambiguous
- Language independent

### Time and Space Complexity
Evalution of performance of algorithms based on input size represented by asymptotic notations
1. Big-O Notation ($O-notation$) - Worst-case complexity
2. Omega Notation ($\Omega -notation$) - Best-case complexity
3. Theta Notation ($\Theta -notation$) - Average-case complexity

## $O-notation$
The worst-case complexity of an algorithm is represented using the Big-O notation.

- $O(1)$ = Constant
- $O(n)$ = Linear
- $O(\log n)$ = Logarithmic

## Big-O Guide
- Calculation not dependent on input size = $O(1)$
- 1 loop = $O(n)$
- 2 nested loops = $O(n^2)$
- Input size reduced by half = $O(\log n)$
